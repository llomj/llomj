It defines a new data type that encapsulates both data (attributes) and functionality (methods) relevant to that type.\n\n- **Purpose**:\n  - The primary purpose of a class is to enable the creation of reusable and organized code. Classes help in modeling real-world entities, allowing developers to structure their code in a way that reflects the problem domain.\n\n- **Components of a Class**:\n  \n  - **Attributes**:\n    - Attributes are the variables associated with a class. They store the state or properties of an object created from the class.\n    - **Instance Attributes**: These are attributes unique to each instance of a class. They are typically defined within methods, often in the constructor (`__init__` method).\n    - **Class Attributes**: These are shared across all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any instance methods. Any changes made to a class attribute will reflect across all instances unless overridden in a specific instance.\n    \n  - **Methods**:\n    - Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors or actions that an object can perform. They can manipulate an object's attributes or perform operations relevant to that object.\n    - **Instance Methods**: These are the most common type of methods that operate on instance attributes. They take `self` as the first parameter to reference the instance.\n    - **Class Methods**: Defined using the `@classmethod` decorator, these methods take `cls` as the first parameter and can access class attributes.\n    - **Static Methods**: Defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator, these methods do not take `self` or `cls` as the first parameter and can be called on the class itself, independent of instance attributes.\n\n- **Creating a Class**:\n  - A class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name (following the CamelCase naming convention) and a colon. The body of the class contains the definitions of attributes and methods.\n  \n    Example:\n    ```python\n    class Car:\n        wheels = 4  # Class attribute\n\n        def __init__(self, color, model):  # Constructor\n            self.color = color  # Instance attribute\n            self.model = model  # Instance attribute\n\n        def start(self):  # Method\n            print(f\"{self.model} is starting.\")\n\n    ```\n\n- **Instantiating Objects**:\n  - Once a class is defined, you can create instances (or objects) of that class. Each object created has its own unique set of instance attributes, while sharing the methods defined by the class.\n  \n    Example:\n    ```python\n    car1 = Car(\"red\", \"Toyota\")\n    car2 = Car(\"blue\", \"Honda\")\n    ```\n\n- **Accessing Attributes and Methods**:\n  - You can access an object’s attributes and methods using the dot (`.`) notation:\n  \n    Example:\n    ```python\n    print(car1.color)  # Accessing an instance attribute\n    car1.start()  # Calling a method\n    ```\n\n- **Benefits**:\n  - **Encapsulation**: Classes encapsulate data and methods, promoting modularity and preventing external interference. This allows for better data protection and manipulation.\n  - **Inheritance**: Classes can inherit from other classes, allowing for the creation of a hierarchy of classes. This feature promotes code reuse, enabling derived classes to inherit attributes and methods from base classes.\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    class ElectricCar(Car):  # Inheriting from Car\n        def charge(self):\n            print(\"Charging the electric car.\")\n    ```\n  - **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows methods to be called on different objects, enabling the same method name to behave differently based on the object that calls it. This enhances flexibility and ease of maintenance.\n  \n- **Common Scenarios**:\n  - Classes are used in applications that require a clear representation of data entities and their behaviors, such as in GUI applications, game development, and simulations.\n  - They are also essential in frameworks and libraries where custom data types are needed.\n\n- **Conclusion**:\n  - In summary, classes are a core concept in Python that facilitate the organization, reuse, and maintenance of code. By encapsulating data and behavior, they provide a powerful way to model complex systems and promote cleaner, more understandable code.\n\n\"\"\"",
